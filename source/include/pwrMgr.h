/**
 *  @file pwrMgr.h
 *  @brief RDKB Power Manger
 *
 *  This file provides the apis and headers for the RDKB Power Manager. The
 *  processing here only handles the messaging to trigger power state transitions.
 *  There is an RDKB companion script which will perform the actual orderly
 *  shutdown and startup of the RDKB CCSP components.
 *
 *  This code is listening for the following power system transition events:
 *  Transition from Battery to AC:
 *  sysevent set rdkb-power-transition POWER_TRANS_AC
 *
 *  Transition from AC to Battery
 *  sysevent set rdkb-power-transition POWER_TRANS_BATTERY
 *
 *  When the transition is complete, the rdkb power state will change:
 *  rdkb-power-state AC
 *  rdkb-power-state BATTERY
 *
